PHP helper classes that I might need to reuse

---

Util class (Util.php)

  + string h (string str, int $flags = ENT_QUOTES, string $encoding = 'UTF-8')
      convenience method for htmlspecialchars with default values

  + boolean isPost ()
      checks if current request was made by POST

  + void redirect (string $url, int $status_code = 302)
      redirects current request to $url with a default HTTP status code of 302
      writes HTML anchor tag if headers already sent
      exits process after redirecting
